%%%%% Wavelet Phase Coherence | Background %%%%%

If this phase difference is found to remain constant {over what length scale (?)}, this indicates {(?)} that the source of the oscillations at this frequency is shared [/common] 
between the two time series. We call these two oscillations [frequency components of the two time series] <italic> phase coherent </italic>

In this way, the phase coherent state can be defined as an [essentially] instantaneous event.

The phase information of a time series is extracted at instances of time through the Windowed Fourier or Wavelet Transform.  
To understand how we can gather [obtain/attain] the phase of oscillations across the whole frequency spectrum through time, read the sections on the <link>Windowed 
Fourier Transform </link> and <link> Wavelet Transform </link>.
