					<h1>Wavelet Phase Coherence</h1>
						<h2>Introduction</h2>
							Coherence is defined for specific frequencies - if the changes in phase and amplitude for a certain oscillation in a time series are the same for the same
							oscillation observed in a different time series, then the oscillations are coherent. It also possible to define amplitude coherence (only the amplitude is
							matching) and phase coherence (only the phase is matching).
							<br><br>
							Synchronisation is related to coherence but is not the same. Oscillations can be coherent without direct coupling, but synchronisation is a result of
							coupling between oscillations. There are different types of synchronisation: phase synchronisation, phase and amplitude synchronisation, Lyapunov 
							synchronisation and also n : m locking, where there are n cycles of one oscillator for each m cycles of the other. 
							<br><br>
							It is possible to use methods that detect phase locking (where the phase shift between two oscillations remains constant) to observe inteactions between signals,
							but if the phase locking is 1:1, then it is not necessary to use phase locking. Instead, the phase coherence can be used: [eq 14]
							\[C_{\phi}(f_{k}) = \sqrt{\left\langle\cos\Delta\phi_{k, n}\right\rangle^{2} + \left\langle\sin\Delta\phi_{k, n}\right\rangle^{2}})\]
							This gives the phase coherence at a given frequency and takes values between 0 and 1. A value of 1 means that the phase difference is the same for all time,
							and a value of 0 means that there is no tendency for the phase difference to remain the same.
							<br><br>
							The phase coherence can also be defined in terms of any time-frequency representation wt with complex values. In the toolbox, the power normalised wavelet
							transform is used, which is the same as using the phase difference definition [(eq 14)] above. [eq 15].
							<br><br>
							The phase coherence can be calculated for all scales s to have a plot of coherence vs. frequency. It is usually more than 0 even for two uncorrelated noise signals
							so you need to be careful when deciding what is a significant coherence. However, even this does not give a full picture, as the lower frequency components
							are observed for fewer cycles. The phase difference varies less when observed over fewer cycles. This results in a bias where the phase coherence between 
							two unrelated signals increases monotonically towards lower frequencies.
							<br><br>
							To account for the bias towards higher coherence at lower frequencies, surrogates are used.The surrogates used here are generated times series which have a
							ll the same properties of the original time series apart from the phase, because the phase difference is what is being tested. There are different ways to
							calculate surrogates which you can see in Advanced Options. After the surrogates are generated, the phase coherence between surrogates is calculated. This
							is then used as a baseline, and a coherence above this is said to be significant.
							<br><br>

							<br><br>To track time-variability of the coherence, a sliding window is used for calculation. The window size can be scaled with frequency, so that there a
							re the same number of cycles in every window. This removes the lower frequency bias and the need for surrogates. The windowing can cause loss of low
							frequency coherence information. Preprocessing is often required to detrend the data, and remove the effect of high harmonics of low frequency oscillations
							that cannot be observed.  At least 5 cycles need to be observed in order to identify coherence, which is an additional difficulty at low frequencies. The 
							cone of influence in the continuous wavelet transform also cuts off information at lower frequencies.
